Abstract—The Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)
is an innovative solution designed to optimize traffic flow on
multi-lane roads while ensuring efficient handling of emergency
vehicles. The system employs state-of-the-art technologies such
as YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection for real-time
vehicle detection and density calculation, along with RFID (Radio
Frequency Identification) for prioritizing emergency vehicles.
The primary objective of the STMS is to enhance traffic man-
agement by dynamically adjusting traffic light durations based
on the density of vehicles in each lane. By leveraging YOLO
object detection, the system continuously monitors video feeds
from multiple lanes captured by webcams or recorded sources.
Through multithreading techniques, concurrent processing of the
video feeds enables real-time detection of vehicles in all lanes
simultaneously, ensuring timely and accurate data collection.
Once vehicles are detected, the STMS calculates the vehicle
density in each lane by analyzing the number of vehicles
present within a specified timeframe. This density information
serves as a crucial input for traffic light control logic, where
lanes with higher vehicle density are granted longer green
light durations to facilitate smoother traffic flow. This adaptive
approach minimizes congestion and reduces travel time for com-
muters, thereby improving overall road efficiency. Furthermore,
the STMS integrates RFID technology to prioritize emergency
vehicles such as ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars. Each
emergency vehicle is equipped with an RFID tag that emits
a unique identifier. When an emergency vehicle approaches a
traffic intersection, the RFID reader installed in the vicinity
detects the tag’s signal, triggering immediate action from the
STMS. In response, the system dynamically adjusts traffic lights
to provide a clear pathway for the emergency vehicle, minimizing
response times and potentially saving lives. The proposed STMS
offers several advantages over traditional traffic management
systems. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision
techniques, it provides real-time insights into traffic conditions,
allowing for adaptive control strategies tailored to specific traffic
patterns. Moreover, the integration of RFID technology ensures
swift and efficient handling of emergency situations, contributing
to enhanced safety and emergency response capabilities on the
road. In conclusion, the Smart Traffic Management System
presented in this paper demonstrates a holistic approach to
traffic optimization and emergency vehicle prioritization. By
combining advanced technologies such as YOLO object detection
and RFID, the system offers a robust solution for modern traffic
management challenges, paving the way for safer and more
efficient urban mobility systems.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Smart Traffic Management System (STMS) is a cutting-
edge solution designed to enhance traffic flow efficiency on
multi-lane roads. By leveraging advanced technologies such as
YOLO object detection and RFID, the system addresses the
challenges of modern urban mobility. Utilizing webcams or
recorded video feeds, the STMS employs YOLO for real-time
vehicle detection and density calculation across multiple lanes
concurrently. Through multithreading techniques, the system
ensures timely processing of video data, enabling efficient
traffic monitoring. Vehicle density information is then used
to dynamically adjust traffic light durations, optimizing signal
timing based on traffic conditions in each lane. Additionally,
RFID tags are incorporated to prioritize emergency vehicles,
ensuring swift passage through intersections when necessary.
This holistic approach not only minimizes congestion and
reduces travel time for commuters but also enhances safety
by facilitating emergency response. In summary, the STMS
represents a comprehensive solution that harnesses the power
of machine learning and [oT technologies to revolutionize
traffic management in urban environments.

The Smart Traffic Management System (STMS) has a
broad application area encompassing urban and suburban road
networks, highways, and intersections. Its primary goal is
to optimize traffic flow and enhance road safety in densely
populated areas with high vehicular traffic. The system is
particularly useful in cities facing congestion issues and those
striving to improve emergency vehicle response times.The
Hardware Components required are LEDs, wires, Arduino
microcontroller, RFID tags and readers, breadboard, resis-
tors,webcam.The Software requirements are YOLO object
detection model, Arduino IDE for programming the micro-
controller.Stable power source to operate the system con-
tinuously.Urban areas often grapple with traffic congestion,
leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and envi-
ronmental pollution. Traditional traffic management systems
may struggle to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions, resulting
in inefficiencies and delays. Moreover, emergency vehicles
face challenges navigating through congested intersections,
potentially delaying critical medical or rescue operations.

The Smart Traffic Management System (STMS) offers a

comprehensive solution to the pervasive problem of urban traf-
fic congestion and inefficient emergency vehicle navigation.
By combining advanced technologies such as YOLO object
detection and RFID, the system revolutionizes traffic man-
agement on multi-lane roads and intersections. Through real-
time vehicle detection and density calculation, STMS provides
accurate insights into traffic conditions, enabling adaptive
control strategies. Utilizing LED traffic lights controlled by Ar-
duino microcontrollers, the system dynamically adjusts signal
timings based on current traffic flow, minimizing congestion
and reducing travel time for commuters. RFID tags installed in
emergency vehicles facilitate their prioritized passage through
intersections, ensuring swift response to critical situations.
With its modular hardware setup including LEDs, wires,
Arduino, RFID components, and a breadboard, STMS offers a
scalable solution adaptable to various urban environments. By
optimizing traffic flow and prioritizing emergency vehicles,
STMS enhances road safety, reduces environmental impact,
and improves overall quality of life in urban areas. Its user-
friendly interface allows for easy monitoring and management
of traffic conditions, providing stakeholders with valuable
insights for decision-making. Ultimately, the Smart Traffic
Management System represents a transformative approach to
urban mobility, addressing key challenges while laying the
foundation for smarter, more efficient cities.

The project significantly contributes to environmental sus-
tainability through its innovative approach to optimizing traffic
flow and reducing congestion. By leveraging advanced tech-
nologies such as real-time video analysis and dynamic traffic
signal control, the system minimizes vehicle idling time and
unnecessary stops, resulting in reduced fuel consumption and
emissions. This translates to lower levels of carbon dioxide and
other harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere, thereby
improving air quality and mitigating the impacts of climate
change. Moreover, the project encourages the adoption of
sustainable transportation modes by promoting public transit,
cycling, and walking, which further reduces the reliance on
individual car travel and associated environmental impacts.
Additionally, by incorporating energy-efficient traffic signals
and smart sensors, the system enhances energy efficiency in ur-
ban transportation infrastructure, contributing to overall energy
savings and a reduced environmental footprint. Ultimately, the
project not only improves traffic management but also fosters
a greener and more sustainable urban environment for present
and future generations.

In the subsequent sections, this paper provides a comprehen-
sive review of the literature, exploring existing research and
advancements in traffic management technologies (Section 2).
It then delves into the intricate details of various prediction
models and the proposed framework, elucidating the method-
ologies employed and the rationale behind their selection
(Section 3). Following this, the paper presents results and
comparative analyses, offering insights into the performance
and efficacy of different prediction models in optimizing traffic
flow (Section 4). Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion
on the implications and future directions of the research,

highlighting potential avenues for further exploration and
innovation in the field of traffic management and optimization
(Section 5).

Il]. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY

A. Proposed System Overview:

Our proposed system takes an image from the CCTV
cameras at traffic junctions as input for real-time traffic density
calculation using image processing and object detection. This
image is passed on to the vehicle detection algorithm, which
uses YOLO. The number of vehicles of each class, such as
car, bike, bus, and truck, is detected, which is to calculate
the density of traffic. The signal switching algorithm uses this
density, among some other factors, to set the green signal timer
for each lane.The green signal time is restricted to a maximum
and minimum value in order to avoid starvation of a particular
lane. This model is implemented on hardware devices using
arduino uno , RFID , breadboard , wires and leds as shown in
fig 1.

‘
ie

Fig. 1. Proposed Working Model

B. Vehicle Detection Module :

The proposed system uses YOLO (You only look once)
for vehicle detection, which provides the desired accuracy
and processing time. A custom YOLO model was trained
for vehicle detection, which can detect vehicles of different
classes like cars, bikes, heavy vehicles (buses and trucks), and
rickshaws. YOLO is a clever convolutional neural network
(CNN) for performing object detection in real-time. The
algorithm applies a single neural network to the full image,
and then divides the image into regions and predicts bounding
boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes

are weighted by the predicted probabilities. YOLO is popular
because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run
in real-time. The algorithm “only looks once” at the image in
the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass
through the neural network to make predictions. After nonmax
suppression (which makes sure the object detection algorithm
only detects each object once), it then outputs recognized
objects together with the bounding boxes. With YOLO, a
single CNN simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes
and class probabilities for those boxes. The backbone CNN
used in YOLO can be further simplified to improve processing
time. Darknet is an open source neural network framework
written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports
CPU and GPU computation . With DarkNet, YOLO achieves
72.9 percent top | accuracy and 91.2 percent top-5 accuracy on
ImageNet. Darknet uses mostly 3 x 3 filters to extract features
and 1 x | filters to reduce output channels. It also uses global
average pooling to make predictions.The dataset for training
the model was prepared by scraping images from google and
labelling them manually using LabellMG, a graphical image
annotation tool . Then the model was trained using the pre-
trained weights downloaded from the YOLO website. The
configuration of the .cfg file used for training was changed in
accordance with the specifications of our model. The number
of output neurons in the last layer was set equal to the number
of classes the model is supposed to detect by changing the
*classes’ variable. In our system, this was 4 viz. Car, Bike,
Bus/Truck, and Rickshaw. The number of filters also needs to
be changed by the formula 5*(5+number of classes), i.e., 45 in
our case. After making these configuration changes, the model
was trained until the loss was significantly less and no longer
seemed to reduce. This marked the end of the training, and
the weights were now updated according to our requirements.
These weights were then imported in code and used for vehicle
detection with the help of OpenCV library. A threshold is set
as the minimum confidence required for successful detection.
After the model is loaded and an image is fed to the model,
it gives the result in a JSON format ie., in the form of key-
value pairs, in which labels are keys, and their confidence
and coordinates are values. Again, OpenCV can be used to
draw the bounding boxes on the images from the labels and
coordinates received.

Fig. 2 shows test images on which our vehicle detection
model was applied. The left side of the figure shows the
original image and the right side is the output after the vehicle
detection model is applied on the image, with bounding boxes
and corresponding labels.

C. Signal Switching Module :

The Signal Switching Algorithm sets the green signal timer
according to traffic density returned by the vehicle detection
module. It also switches between the signals cyclically accord-
ing to the timers. The algorithm takes the information about
the vehicles that were detected from the detection module, as
explained in the previous section, as input. This is in JSON
format, with the label of the object detected as the key and the

Fig. 2. Vehicle Detection Results

confidence and coordinates as the values. This input is then
parsed to calculate the total number of vehicles of each class.
After this, the green signal time for the signal is calculated
and assigned to it, and the red signal times of other signals
are adjusted accordingly. The algorithm can be scaled up or
down to any number of signals at an intersection. All the
four frames continuously give corresponding count and vehicle
density with the help of multithreading. Once the green timer
of the current signal becomes zero, the next signal becomes
green for the amount of time set by the algorithm. The green
signal time is then calculated using (1).

where:
« GST is green signal time

« averageTimeOfClass is the average time the vehicles of
that class take to cross an intersection, and
« noOfLanes is the number of lanes at the intersection
Based on the green signal time the corresponding green leds
are turned on. Now on the arrival of a emergency vehicle,
the corresponding rfid reader reads the rfid tag and then
dynamically switches on the green light for the lane where
the emergency vehicle has arrived.

D. Hardware Integration :

The system integrates various hardware components includ-
ing cameras, arduino uno , RFID readers, and LEDs to monitor
traffic density, prioritize emergency vehicles, and dynamically

control traffic signals. High-definition cameras capture live
video feeds of traffic movements at intersections, which are
then processed in real-time by arduino uno using computer
vision algorithms to estimate vehicle density in each lane.
Based on this analysis, the system dynamically adjusts traffic
signal timings to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.
Additionally, RFID readers installed in emergency vehicles
communicate with RFID tags placed at intersections, allowing
for priority access during emergencies as shown in fig4.

IV. RESULT ANALYSIS

A. Working :

The system works by taking live camera videos with the
help of webcam in the four lanes , it then calculates the
vehicle density in all the four lanes simultaneously with
the help of multithreading in python ( simultaneous execu-
tion of multiple processes). As per the calculated vehicle
density the corresponding green signal is switched on for
the particular lane in loop. On the arrival of emergency
vehicle, the corresponding Rfid tag is activated indicating a
emergency vehicle and the system dynamically switches to

that particular lane. The system operates in a closed-loop
manner, continuously monitoring traffic conditions, analyzing
data, and adapting traffic signal control strategies accordingly.
Through the seamless integration of hardware components and
intelligent algorithms, the STMS provides an efficient and
reliable solution for addressing traffic management challenges
in urban environments, ultimately improving overall road
safety and efficiency.

B. Performance:

The vehicle detection module was tested with a variety of
test images containing varying amounts of vehicles, and the
accuracy of detection was found to be in the range of 75-80
percent. This is satisfactory, but not optimum. The primary
reason for low accuracy is the lack of a proper dataset. To
improve upon this, real-life footage from traffic cameras can
be used to train the model, so that accuracy of the system can
be improved.

On running the model on prerecorded videos as shown in
the GU] interface in fig6 the following timings were observed
for the 4 lanes in a continuous loop as shown in table1.

V. CONCLUSION

In this project, we developed a Smart Traffic Management
System (STMS) aimed at optimizing traffic flow and enhanc-
ing road safety in urban areas. Through the integration of
YOLO object detection for vehicle density estimation and
RFID technology for emergency vehicle prioritization, the sys-
tem offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges of urban.
traffic congestion. Our experimental results demonstrated the
effectiveness of the STMS in accurately monitoring vehicle
density across multiple lanes in real-time. By dynamically

tions, the system effectively reduced congestion and improved
overall road efficiency. Additionally, the integration of RFID

prioritization, facilitating swift passage through intersections
during critical situations. Looking ahead, further enhance-
ments to the STMS could involve the incorporation of machine
learning algorithms for predictive traffic analysis and adaptive
signal control. Moreover, expanding the system’s scalability
and interoperability to accommodate larger urban environ-
ments and diverse traffic scenarios would be beneficial for
broader deployment and adoption. In conclusion, the STMS

tra!

fic management systems, contributing to safer and more

sustainable urban transportation networks.
